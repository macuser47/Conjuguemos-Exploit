# Conjuguemos-Exploit
Homework too hard? Try DOM manipulation.

Many Spanish and other language students have had to use conjuguemos to do assignments, tediously working through one problem after the next, steadily losing what precious free time they had remaining.

But no more.

Enter the conjuguemos expoit, a chrome extension to get an instant 100%.
Just activate it by clicking the red button, and watch the 100% appear on you screen.

It's that easy.

Yep, the developers of conjuguemos were stupid enough to put grading client-side.

Cheers,
